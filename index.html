                        <p>
                            Hello, Zap, bebs, my fiancée! I don’t even know what to call you anymore because you have so many nicknames from me, but that just shows how special you are! The more nicknames, the better, right? I wrote this letter to you as an appreciation for everything you are to me, my one and only Zappy, my kakampi, and my partner in all things.

First of all, thank you so much for being there for me. Even though we haven't known each other for long, you always find time for me, and I can’t tell you how much that means. Before you came into my life, I didn’t have someone I could truly rely on, but you’ve changed that. You make me happy with the smallest things, whether we’re playing games together or having deep, serious conversations. Just knowing I can count on you has brought me so much peace.

I want you to remember that I'm always here for you too. You can show me your vulnerable side, and I’ll never judge you. I want to be your safe place, your comfort, and the person you can run to whenever you need.

Also, you’re so beautiful just as you are, inside and out. Please, please take care of yourself and don’t overdo the dieting. You don’t need to change a thing because you're perfect as you are! Always remember, a “perfect” body doesn’t define who you are—your kindness, beauty, and spirit do.

Thank you for being in my life, Zap. I’m endlessly grateful for you, and I’m excited for everything we’ll experience together. I love you endlessly, my pretty, kind, and wonderful fiancée.
                        </p>
